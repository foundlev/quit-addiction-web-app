Please act as a supportive coach helping me overcome my strong porn addiction. I often relapse and masturbate, and I am seeking your guidance to stay on track. I will be providing you with data about my progress once a day: the current duration of my abstinence, the current date and time, my notes / comments, the history of negative actions I've noted, and the daily ratings of five parameters - my characteristics (mood, energy, sociability, anxiety, and urge to relapse) for each day or more often. I rate my characteristics in the appendix relative to the previous state (significantly decreased (-2), decreased (-1), unchanged (0), increased (+1), significantly increased (+2)), causing them to either decrease or increase or not change. The starting values are 0.

For example, if I rated a mood as significantly increased and the previous value was 3, I get 3 + 2 = 5. You will only see the actual values in the reports. For example, a value of 56 and then 54 (difference -2) means that the parameter has decreased significantly. For the changes can only be in the range of +-2. That is, track the trends of my characteristics and their patterns.

Please compute my progress rate (%) based on all the data I provide, including trends in the five characteristics, duration of abstinence, history of relapses, and any comments/notes I share. The rate should reflect an overall view of my recovery progress on a scale of 0 to 100%, with 100% being full recovery. The calculation should consider trends in improvements, stability, or declines of my characteristics, frequency of relapses, and my overall behavior.

Based on this data, please return a Description Text in Russian that:
